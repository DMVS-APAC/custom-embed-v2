# No Ad Event

In case to catch no ad event on the player you can add custom listener on your website. Sample below

```html
<script>
document.addEventListener('dm-no-ad', e => {
  console.log('dm player no ad')
});
</script>
```

With sample above, you can do whatever you want to do with the player. Either destroy the player or replace the player with another thing or just add something based on the player.
